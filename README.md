# Overview

This application was built to manage FHE assignments and it does just that. This was built using VueJS as a project to improve my knowledge of the framework.

The application is simple. It provides the user with a template to edit the assignments given to family members through a drop down menu.

# Development Environment

This application was built using VueJS. The backend was originally built using .NET, but was moved to Ruby on Rails to decrease time to delivery.

The program was writen using JavaScript on a VueJS framework using Pinia for state management and axios for http requests.
